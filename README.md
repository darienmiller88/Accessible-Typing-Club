# Accessible Typing Club

This project will be a easier to use, accessible verison of the already existing typing club that will significantly easier for my disabled adult cohort to use. Right now with the already exisitng typing club, a number of issues make it difficult for them to use:

- Highlighted key on keyboard guide is too small
- Ads shrink the view, and clutter the web page
- The indicator of which key they must currently type is also too small.
